=======================================================

MULTIPLAYER S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat

LAN and Direct IP Multiplayer Connect:

Players can connect to each other either locally over a Local Area Network (LAN) or remotely via direct IP connection. Both connection types use the TCP/IP protocol. To host or join either type of game, select Network Game from the main menu.

Product Key Required
• You must have installed S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat with a valid product key in order to connect and play online. A product key cannot be connected by two PCs at the same time. If upon connection you receive an error message related to your product key, please re-install S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat and enter a valid product key.

Firewall settings
• Hosting multiplayer games from behind a router/firewall/proxy is not currently supported. Players can connect to a host using the following information.
If you are behind a firewall/proxy and are able to configure its settings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat needs the following TCP ports open in order to function: 
6667 (IRC)
3783 (Voice Chat Port) 
27900 (Master Server UDP Heartbeat) 
28900 (Master Server List Request) 
29900 (GP Connection Manager) 
29901 (GP Search Manager) 
13139 (Custom UDP Pings) 
6515 (Dplay UDP)
6500 (Query Port)
Make sure that S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat appears on your Windows Firewall exception list, and the exception lists of other firewall products you are currently running. If you are behind a DMZ, disable all on-access scanners.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s installer automatically adds the game to the list of exceptions for Windows Firewall.

Antivirus software
• Many users of antivirus software (such as Nvidia Access Manager, NOD32, Norton, PandaSoft, etc.) are unable to connect to GameSpy, experience poor performance or game crashes. If you experience trouble, we suggest that users place S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat on the exception lists for these software products or otherwise disable them during gameplay.

PERFORMANCE TIPS 

To improve performance, from the main menu, select Options, and then select the Video tab. Any of the following should result in improved performance.

—Change Render to Static Lighting
—Lower the Quality Settings to Medium, Low or Minimum
—Lower the game resolution to 1024x768 or lower
—Enable Full Screen
—Under the Advanced button, lower the settings for Vision Distance, Anisotropic Filtering, Antialiasing, and Shadows Quality

Background Applications and Performance 
Programs that run in the background while on the Internet, such as ICQ, web browsers, voice communication applications, or file sharing programs cut into the speed at which S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat plays. Turning off these Internet-specific applications can also increase your game speed. Antivirus and firewall software also commonly contribute to performance issues. If you experience performance problems with Antivirus or firewall software, try to configure the software to exclude S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat from security checks. Contact your software vendor for details.

System RAM and Performance 
Another method of increasing performance in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is to add RAM to your computer if you are playing on a 512MB system. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat can consume a great deal of memory in very large games causing the system to use virtual memory. This process is slower than using RAM directly, and while the speed of your processor is a factor in the performance of the game, additional memory can greatly enhance your game speed on baseline systems. Please ensure that virtual memory is enabled in your operating system.

Dual Core and Performance
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat should utilize your dual and quad core processor natively and automatically. Running a dual or quad core processor is one of the best ways to improve performance.

Updated Video Drivers
It is highly recommended that you install the latest drivers for you video card. These can be downloaded from your video card manufacturer's website. Please visit http://www.asus.com/ depending on the type of card you have.

Updated Sound Drivers
If you are experiencing problems with audio, or general performance problems, you should check with your sound card manufacturer to see if there are updated drivers available. These can usually be obtained from the sound card manufacturer's website.

Motherboard Drivers
Often motherboard drivers are overlooked when updating systems, and as a result most computers are running very old versions that simply do not work properly and may cause very noticeable slow downs and stability issues. Please check with your motherboard manufacturer to see if there are updated drivers available.
